Greetings, brave adventurer!

I'm a developer and analyst questing through the realms of code, forging robust solutions and enchanting user experiences. My journey involves exploring new technologies and mastering the ancient arts of programming.

**My Adventurer's Toolkit (Tech Stack):**

*   **Core Class Abilities (Languages):** Python, C, C++ (my trusty sword, shield and spellbook)
*   **Ancient Tomes of Data (Databases):** SQL (for deciphering the secrets held within)
*   **Enchanting User Interfaces (Frontend):** React (weaving illusions to delight and guide)
*   **Master of the Terminal Wilds (OS & CLI):** Linux & Bash Scripting (navigating any digital landscape with ease)
*   **Pocket Dimensions & Portals (Containers):** Docker (for reliably deploying my creations across different maps and realms)

**Currently Leveling Up My Skill Tree:**

*   **JavaScript:** Unlocking new potential for the frontend
*   **Node.js:** Venturing deeper into the backend caverns for powerful server-side loot

**Quests & Lore (My Projects):**
Please feel free to explore my repository â€“ a log of my completed quests and ongoing adventures. Perhaps you'll find some useful artefacts or ancient knowledge!

May your builds always compile and your loot be legendary...
